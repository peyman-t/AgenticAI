# AgenticAI

This repository is a course repository: "Agentic AI — from business needs to working agents". It contains course material, templates, and sample agents (including n8n examples) to help teams design, implement, and iterate on agentic solutions.

## Contents

- [templates/](templates/) — Reusable agent templates, workflows, and boilerplate you can adapt for projects.
- n8n sample agents — Example workflows and connectors demonstrating how to orchestrate agents with n8n (see `templates/`).

## Goals

- Explain when and why to use agentic architectures in product and business contexts.
- Provide hands-on templates and runnable examples to accelerate prototyping.
- Show integration patterns (e.g., automation with n8n) and best practices for safety, observability, and iteration.

## Getting started

1. Open this workspace in the provided dev container (Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS).
2. Inspect the templates in [templates/](templates/) to find starter agents and workflow examples.
3. To open links in the host browser from the container, use:
```
```
4. Run or adapt example agents from [templates](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) to match your data sources and tooling.

## Contributing

- Add new templates or sample agents under [templates](http://_vscodecontentref_/1).
- Keep examples small, documented, and reproducible.
